# WhatsAPP-Clone

This project was built using the M.E.R.N stack.

## About The Clone

This clone you will have the ability to chat with other users in real time just as the original WhatsApp with a real time database.

In the project I used the M.E.R.N stack. Using JavaScript's framework React.js as the FrontEnd, MongoDB as the database and taking advantage of MongoDB's ChangeStream and Pusher to make it a real time database.
